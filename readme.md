# 🧩 Sudoku Solver

A Python-based solver capable of solving any valid **9x9 Sudoku puzzle**.  
This implementation applies a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm to explore possible solutions based on the puzzle’s initial values.

## 📖 Overview
Sudoku is a classic logic-based puzzle. This solver demonstrates how search algorithms can be applied to constraint satisfaction problems.  

While BFS guarantees correctness, it is not always the most efficient approach for Sudoku puzzles. This project serves as both a solver and a foundation for experimenting with alternative algorithms.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
I welcome contributions and suggestions! Potential improvements include:  
- 🔢 Support for **different puzzle sizes** (e.g., 4x4, 16x16)  
- ⚡ Integration of **more efficient algorithms** (e.g., Backtracking, Constraint Propagation, Dancing Links)  
- 🎨 Enhancing the  **graphical interface** for better visualization and interaction
